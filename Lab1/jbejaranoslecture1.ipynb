You can't import every library on Quantopian due to security issues, but you can import most of the common scientific ones. Here I import numpy and pandas, the two most common and useful libraries in quant finance. I recommend copying this import statement to every new notebook.\n","\n","Notice that you can rename libraries to whatever you want after importing. The `as` statement allows this. Here we use `np` and `pd` as aliases for `numpy` and `pandas`. This is a very common aliasing and will be found in most code snippets around the web. The point behind this is to allow you to type fewer characters when you are frequently accessing these libraries."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"mHkrPsv5Hc0E"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# This is a plotting library for pretty pictures.\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HX4cFlSwHc0E"},"source":["##Tab Autocomplete\n","\n","Pressing tab will give you a list of IPython's best guesses for what you might want to type next.
